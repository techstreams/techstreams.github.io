title: iOS Automation With Workflow
tags: [workflow]

We all have workflows we use for our work. But what is a workflow really?  

A simple [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Aworkflow) returns this definition:

> *the sequence of industrial, administrative, or other processes through which a piece of work passes from initiation to completion*

I like that definition.  But what I like ***better*** are tools which ***automate and simplify*** workflows.  

I've found one such tool in the **[Workflow](https://workflow.is/)** app.

According to it's website, the **[Workflow](https://workflow.is/)** app is:

> *Powerful automation made simple.*

Translated ... the **[Workflow](https://workflow.is/)** app enables you to connect apps together, combined with powerful actions, to automate workflow on your iPhone or iPad.  

Workflows are easy to create with a simple *drag-and-drop* interface and have a variety of uses.

For example, use the **[Workflow](https://workflow.is/)** app to:

* Backup photos to [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) with a simple tap
* Access the next couple of meetings scheduled in your calendar and create [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) formatted meeting note templates in [Evernote](https://evernote.com)
* Grab the last five images from your photo gallery, make an animated GIF and text it to a friend
* Get your current and destination locations, access maps and text others about your approximate arrival time
* Speed dial a phone number
* Grab the content of a web page, create a PDF and automatically open it in [iBooks](https://www.apple.com/ibooks/)
* Translate your clipboard content to another language and email it
* Tweet the content and URL of the page you are viewing in your browser
* Cross-post a photo to [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com), [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/)
* Get directions to the nearest coffee shop

*The possibilities are endless ...*

The fun parts about the **[Workflow](https://workflow.is/)** app?  

* Make your own workflows and save them to your home screen where they can be accessed with a quick tap
* Create workflow extensions which plug into other apps
* Export workflows to share with others
* Install workflows shared by others or access workflows from the built-in ***Workflow Gallery***

I'll be sharing some of my favorite *(and created)* workflows in future posts.

You can **[download](https://workflow.is/download)** the **[Workflow](https://workflow.is/)** app from the App Store.
