**[Google Forms](http://www.google.com/forms/about/)** are powerful. They are easy to build and share ... and provide an excellent collection and analysis tool for submitted data through associated spreadsheets.  But sometimes I want form submissions to show up in my email for other processing.  

That's why I created **TSContactForm**.

> **[TSContactForm](http://techstreams.github.io/TSContactForm/)** is a [Google Apps Script](http://www.google.com/script/start/) for **Google Forms** which automatically emails the form owner each time a user submits a response to the form.  Emails are nicely formatted and contain the content of the form submission. 

You can find the **TSContactForm** install instructions and documentation **[here](http://techstreams.github.io/TSContactForm/)**.

If you are unfamiliar with **Google Forms** or how easy they are to create watch this video.
