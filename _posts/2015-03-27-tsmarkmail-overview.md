I've done technical support both professionally and personally and on my ***wish list*** has always been a support tool with the following criteria:

* Quick content creation in plain text *(i.e., [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/))*
* Ability to embed screenshots and images
* Enable sending content via email directly from source 
* Allow content archival in a labeled, searchable format for easy retrieval and reuse

Leveraging the [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) platform, I decided to build a simple ***Google Docs Add-on*** to provide this functionality.  It's called **TSMarkMail**.

**[TSMarkMail](http://tsmarkmail.tech-streams.com)** is a ***Google Docs Add-on*** which converts [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) *(an easy-to-read-and-write plain text syntax developed by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/))* into a nicely formatted email which can be sent directly from a Google Document.  

*Here are TSMarkMail overview slides.*

**TSMarkMail highlights:**

* Install and access TSMarkMail from the convenient *Add-ons* menu in ***any*** Google Document
* Create content using [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
* Take advantage of Google Document [Chat and Real-time Colloboration](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/2494891)
* Insert images through the Google Document menu *(or by referencing externally hosted images with markdown image syntax)*
* Easily select single or multiple email recipients with *Google Contacts* integration
* Send nicely formatted emails with automatic markdown conversion and image embedding *(with an option to preview before sending)*
* Take advantage of Google Drive folders and search to archive and reuse content
* Create and update content from your [mobile device](https://support.google.com/docs/topic/6039984)


**TSMarkMail** is not only a good tool for technical support, but also can be used by anyone wanting a easy way to compose, send and reuse plain text content.

You can find the **TSMarkMail** install instructions, documentation and a markdown guide **[here](http://tsmarkmail.tech-streams.com)**.
