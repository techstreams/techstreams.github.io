The **[Google Forms](http://www.google.com/forms/about/)** I create are generally intended for an English speaking audience.   But what if my audience natively speaks another language?   

I decided to answer that question by building **TSFormTranslator**.

> **[TSFormTranslator](http://techstreams.github.io/TSFormTranslator/)** is a demonstration [Google Apps Script](http://www.google.com/script/start/) which enables a Google Form owner to translate a form ***created in English*** into one of ***79 different languages*** using [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/).
> 
> Once the form has been translated and shared, *form users* can submit responses in the ***form's language***.
> 
> A nicely formatted email containing the submitted content will be sent to the *form owner* in both the ***form language*** and ***English translation*** each time a *form user* submits to the form.

You can find the **TSFormTranslator** install instructions, documentation and a list of supported languages **[here](http://techstreams.github.io/TSFormTranslator/)**.

If you are unfamiliar with **Google Forms** or how easy they are to create watch this video.
