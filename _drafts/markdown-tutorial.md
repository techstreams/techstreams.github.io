#  Markdown - A Quick Tutorial

I use markdown in almost all of my workflows so I thought it would be a good idea to share a quick tutorial.  

In future posts, I'll be sharing specifics on how I use markdown ... but for now let's lay some ground work on markdown itself.

... <quick overview of markdown>
... <variations of markdown>

***Example workflows in which I use markdown?***  I use markdown to:

* Write all posts for this blog
* Create and send emails from [Google Docs]() with my [TSMarkMail Google Doc Add-on]()
* Initiate many of my [Drafts workflows]()
* Initiate many of my [Workflow app workflows]()
* Write documentation for my [Github projects]()
* Write ebooks with [Gitbook]()

In this tutorial, I'm highlighting the markdown elements which I use most frequently:

* Paragraph 
* Text Emphasis
* Headings
* Blockquote
* List
* Horizontal Rule
* Link
* Image
* Table 
* Code

## Paragraph

Start paragraph text at the document left margin.

Separate paragraphs from other markdown elements (including other paragraphs) with one or more new lines.

Lines of text within a paragraph are continuous. To separate lines within the same paragraph, add two space characters to the end of the previous line.

## Text Emphasis

Create emphasis by surrounding text with special symbols.

To render text as **Bold**, surround text in:

* two consecutive asterisks `**`
* two consecutive underscores `__`


To render text as *Italics*, surround text in:

* a single asterisk `*`
* a single underscore `_`

To render text in ***Bold Italics***, surround text in:

* three consecutive astersks `***`
* three consecutive underscores `___`

To render text as ~~Strikethrough~~, surround text in:

* two consecutive tildas `~~`

## Heading

There are **six levels** of headings possible in markdown. 

Create a heading by typing the `#` symbol followed by a space character and the heading text. 

*(Enter the number of `#` symbols per heading level.)*

## Blockquote

Create a blockquote by typing a `>` symbol followed by a space character and the blockquote text. 

Blockquotes can also be nested by typing consecutive `>` symbols.
