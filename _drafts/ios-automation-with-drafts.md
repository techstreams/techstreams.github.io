iOS Automation with Drafts
workflow drafts

**[Drafts](http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/)** is one of my favorite iOS apps for many of my ***[workflows](https://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Aworkflow)***.  So what is **[Drafts](http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/)** and why do I like it?

According to the **[website](http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/)**:
> *Drafts is a different kind of note taking app. In Drafts, text comes first â€“ open the app and get a new, blank draft. Get your text down quickly, then act on it with powerful actions.*

As the description indicates, **Drafts** is all about ***the text*** ... writing, capturing, viewing, manipulating and saving ***text***.  _In fact, I wrote this blog post on my iPhone with **Drafts** using a workflow similar to that described by [Matteo Cappadonna](http://www.matteocappadonna.org/) in his blog post [Posting with Drafts, Working Copy and Workflow](http://www.matteocappadonna.org/Posting-with-Drafts,-Working-Copy-and-Workflow/)._ 

The text capabilities alone make **Drafts** a powerful text editor.  But with ***[Actions](https://agiletortoise.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/200579370-Actions)*** & ***[Keyboard Extensions](https://agiletortoise.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/200539204-Enhanced-Keyboard)***, limitless possibilities emerge.  Here are a few:

* Cross-post to multiple social media networks including [Twitter](https://twitter.com), [Facebook](https://facebook.com) and [Google+](https://plus.google.com).
* Use [Markdown](https://agiletortoise.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204022848) to create, append to or pretend to files in [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com), [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/), [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) and [iCloud Drive](http://www.apple.com/icloud/icloud-drive/?cid=wwa-us-kwg-features).
* Quickly insert often used text with [TextExpander Touch](https://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/touch/index.html) support, including "fill-ins". *(TextExpander Touch is a Typing Shortcuts app for iOS.)*
* Integrate with many third party apps like [Workflow](https://workflow.is/), [Taskmator](https://mobile.twitter.com/taskmator) and [CodeHub](http://dillonbuchanan.com/CodeHub/) with URL-based actions.
* [Reorder](https://agiletortoise.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203271330) lines of text with drag and drop. 
* Integrate with iOS system apps and services such as Email, Messages, Reminders, Events and Clipboard.
* Import/Export text from any source supporting the iOS Document Picker.
* Clip text and URLs directly from the browser.
* Use [JavaScript Action Steps](https://agiletortoise.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202771590-Action-Step-Script) and [Keyboard Extensions](https://agiletortoise.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202865034-Using-the-Enhanced-Keyboard) to manipulate text.

In addition to **Drafts'** built-in functionality, you can find more *Actions & Keyboard extensions* in the **[Drafts Action Directory](http://drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com/)** ... ***OR*** ... create your own.

In upcoming posts I'll be sharing some of my favorite and created ***Drafts*** *Actions &  Keyboard extensions*, along with some workflow tips and tricks.
